  -- * Error handling in hslua
  -- | We are trying to keep error handling on the haskell side very simple and
  -- intuitive. However, when combined with error handling on the Lua side, it
  -- get's tricky: We can call Haskell from Lua which calls Lua again etc. At
  -- each language boundary we should check for errors and propagate them
  -- properly to the next level in stack. Hslua does this for you when returning
  -- from Lua to Haskell, but care must be taken when passing errors back into
  -- Lua.
  --
  -- Let's say we have this call stack: (stack grows upwards)
  --
  -- > Haskell function
  -- > Lua function
  -- > Haskell program
  --
  -- and we want to report an error in the top-most Haskell function. We can't
  -- use @lua_error@ from the Lua C API, because it uses @longjmp@, which means
  -- it skips layers of abstractions, including the Haskell RTS. There's no way
  -- to prevent this @longjmp@. @lua_pcall@ sets the jump target, but even with
  -- @lua_pcall@ it's not safe. Consider this call stack:
  --
  -- > Haskell function which calls lua_error
  -- > Lua function, uses pcall
  -- > Haskell program
  --
  -- This program jumps to Lua function, skipping Haskell RTS code that would run
  -- before Haskell function returns. For this reason we can use
  -- @lua_pcall@ (@'pcall'@) only for catching errors from Lua, and even in that case
  -- we need to make sure there are no Haskell calls between error-throwing Lua
  -- call and our @'pcall'@ call.
  --
  -- To be able to catch errors from Haskell functions in Lua, we need to find a
  -- convention. Currently hslua does this: @'lerror'@ has same type as Lua's
  -- @lua_error@, but instead of calling real @lua_error@, it's returning two
  -- values: A special value @_HASKELLERR@ and error message as a string.
  --
  -- Using this, we can write a function to catch errors from Haskell like this:
  --
  -- > function catch_haskell(ret, err_msg)
  -- >     if ret == _HASKELLERR then
  -- >       print("Error caught from Haskell land: " .. err_msg)
  -- >       return
  -- >     end
  -- >     return ret
  -- > end
  --
  -- (`_HASKELLERR` is created by `newstate`)
  --
  -- (Type errors in Haskell functions are also handled using this convention.
  -- E.g., if you pass a Lua value with the wrong type to a Haskell function,
  -- the error will be reported in this way)
  --
  -- At this point our call stack is like this:
  --
  -- > Lua function (Haskell function returned with error, which we caught)
  -- > Haskell program
  --
  -- If we further want to propagate the error message to Haskell program, we we
  -- can just use standard @error@ function and use @'pcall'@ in Haskell side.
  -- Note that if we use @error@ on the Lua side and forget to use `pcall` in
  -- the calling Haskell function, we would be starting to skip layers of
  -- abstractions and would get a segfault in the best case. That's why hslua
  -- wraps all API functions that can potentially fail in custom C functions.
  -- Those functions behave idential to the functions they wrap, but catch all
  -- errors and return error codes instead. Using @error@ within Lua should
  -- hence be safe.
  --
  -- However, the raw C API bindings in @'Foreign.Lua.RawBindings'@ don't
  -- provide these guarantees. Even an apparently harmless operations like
  -- accessing a field via @'lua_getfield'@ can call a meta method and trigger a
  -- @longjmp@, causing the host program to crash.
  --
  -- The @'pcall'@ function is not wrapped in additional C code but still safe.
  -- The reason it's safe is because the @lua_pcall@ C function is calling the
  -- Lua function using Lua C API, and when the called Lua function calls
  -- @error@ it @longjmp@s to @lua_pcall@ C function, without skipping any
  -- layers of abstraction. @lua_pcall@ then returns to Haskell.
  --
  -- NOTE: If you're loading a hslua program compiled to a dynamic library from
  -- a Lua program, you need to define @_HASKELLERR = {}@ manually, after
  -- creating the Lua state.
